Greetings to all dream creators across the globe.
The purpose of creating this framework was to make it easy to work with css for everyone, and in designing this framework, I tried to make it as close to human language as possible. Therefore, you will not need an official document to learn this framework, and you can create the best and most interesting websites by just using the code editor Webstorm and knowing a little English and CSS, and of course reading the source code of this open source framework once. Design without leaving HTML codes.
I avoided minimizing this framework, but you can minimize this framework to use this framework so that it occupies less of your server's resources.
I cloned Facebook in one of the repositories of this GitHub page using this first version of this framework.
I am confident in my hand made and I will use it in any project. Thank you even if you don't intend to use this.

In the next updates, I will add more customization styles and implement responsive pages, completely similar and even better than Bootstrap.
#Hello World
